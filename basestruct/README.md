### Base

A simple struct to be embedded by other struct
```go
type Base struct {
  Err           error  `json:"Err,omitempty"`
  LogLevel      int    `json:"LogLevel,omitempty"`
  Initialized   bool   `json:"Initialized,omitempty"`
  MyType        string `json:"MyType,omitempty"` // Store typename. Cheaper way than reflector for logging.
  OnErrContinue bool   `json:"OnErrContinue,omitempty"`
}
```

### CheckErrInit

```go
func (b *Base) CheckErrInit(prefix string) (pass bool)
```

To be put at the beginning of Check error and initialization state in following order:

1. If `OnErrContinue` is `true` -> check passed -> return `true`
2. If `Err` not nil -> check failed -> return `false`
3. If `Initialized` is `false` -> check failed -> set `Err` -> return `false`
4. All else, check passed -> return `true`
